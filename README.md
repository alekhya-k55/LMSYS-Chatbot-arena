Abstract from our paper: 

We walk you through our processes of training models that will predict human preferences 
in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Human Preference. For the competition, we focused on training three 
different models inspired by the codes that were made available on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena 
Competition forum.  
We first started by testing the Gemma-Keras-Inference notebook and the DeBERTa Keras NLP notebook. 
Both our attempts at fine-tuning these pre-trained models were time-consuming and we were not able to 
obtain the best results we had hoped for. We then decided to quit using any pretrained models that were 
available and instead decided to build our own Neural Network, a small one but efficient. It was when 
using our own model and training it that produced better results.  
We attempt to show you that building relatively small models (ours was a mere 5 layers) can give you 
results close to the ones that are produced when using large pre-trained models. While our at-home model 
gives us a very humble result of 1.098, it is rather impressive that we can get comparable results.
